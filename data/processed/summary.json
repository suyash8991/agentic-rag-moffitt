    "We are interested in the following areas: (1) Role and regulation of mitochondrial antioxidant system in cancer cells. (2) Mitochondria and redox signaling crosstalk in cancer cells. (3) Redox vulnerabilities of human malignancies, focusing on selenoproteins. (4) The impact of onco-viral infection (EBV, HBV and HPV) on the redox status of cancer cells.\n  *": 2,
    "My laboratory will adopt an interdisciplinary approach, combining principles from engineering and systems biology to develop integrated tools and methodologies for basic cancer research. Specifically, my group will focus on three key objectives: 1) develop 3D ex vivo microtumor models for therapeutic drug screen, 2) investigate the physical science of cancer on immune evasion, drug delivery, and tumor progression, 3) define biophysical stressors that contribute to tumor invasion, metastasis, and dormancy.\n  *": 2,

    "Dr. Gatenby spearheaded the formation of a new program at Moffitt titled Integrative Mathematical Oncology (IMO). The IMO brings to the Cancer Center a cadre of applied mathematicians to collaborate with tumor biologists and clinical oncologists. The goal is to use the mathematics developed for other nonlinear dynamical systems to examine the physiology of a tumor incorporating factors such as phenotypic evolution, intracellular communication pathways and interactions with microenvironmental factors including therapies. The program fosters continuous interaction between mathematicians and experimentalists as they form explicit comprehensive theoretical models to serve as a framework for understanding cancer\u2019s development, progression and treatment. The IMO, led by Dr. Gatenby, represents an experiment in rethinking paradigms in medical research. A key purpose of the IMO is to provide the quantitative methods that will allow experimentalists and clinicians to frame their hypotheses, simulate their experimental design in-silico, and identify first principles that govern cancer growth and treatment. Dr. Gatenby aims to make progress using methods that have been successful in the physical sciences for centuries \u2014through an iterative partnership between mathematically-oriented theoreticians, biologists and clinical physicians.\n  *": 2,
    "My goal is to bring novel targeted therapies and combination treatment strategies to gynecologic oncology patients via phase I/II clinical trials. In order to achieve those goals, I have established a translational lab that utilizes the capabilities of patient-derived model systems. My active tissue collection protocols in ovarian and endometrial cancer allow for the collection of patient tumor and/or ascites at the time of surgery, biopsies, and / or paracentesis. These patient samples are used to generate patient-derived microtumor explants in a novel perfusion system in collaboration with Dr. Gregory Sawyer in BioEngineering and patient-derived xenograft models (PDXs) in collaboration with Dr. Elsa Flores. I also work closely with my primary research mentor, Dr. Uwe Rix, in Drug Discovery, in order to identify novel targeted combination treatment options for different molecular subsets of ovarian and endometrial cancer using compounds that are clinically available in order to facilitate rapid translation to the clinic. Potential targeted combinations are validated, and mechanisms interrogated in available established cell lines and primary patient-derived 2D and 3D cultures. The microtumor explants and PDX models are used to confirm in vitro findings. Based on our preclinical studies, my goal is to propose investigator-initiated trials, which will utilize the microtumor explant culture system as a BioEngineering tool to help improve translational endpoints. Beyond the aforementioned research interests, I collaborate extensively with investigators across multiple departments at Moffitt, including faculty in BioEngineering, Immunology, Integrated Mathematical Oncology, Drug Discovery, Molecular Oncology, and Internal Medicine. By integrating this diverse expertise, my goal is to develop innovative and targeted therapeutic approaches that challenge and ultimately shift current treatment paradigms. Through these collaborative efforts, I aim to expand the possibilities for effective, personalized care and offer more patients a meaningful change at long term survival or cure for their ovarian cancer. \n  *": 2,
    "My research interests lie at the intersection of biomedical data science, high-performance computing, and precision oncology. I have two active areas of research: Software Tools for Biomedicine: I build software tools for cancer and biomedical data science, including individual analysis packages, machine learning applications, interactive visualizations, and software platforms/infrastructure. I am a lead investigator for the Galaxy computational workbench (https://galaxyproject.org/), which is used by thousands of scientists across the world. Precision Cancer Medicine: I apply computational tools and software platforms to identify biomarkers associated with cancer susceptibility, progression, and response to therapy. Recently I have led the creation and analysis of multimodal, spatial, and single-cell molecular tumor atlases to identify tumor adaptations to therapy and potential approaches to mitigate these adaptations.\n  *": 2,
    "Dr. Luca's research harnesses the power of directed evolution to understand how molecular signals control cellular behavior. Directed evolution enables us to evolve proteins \"in a test tube\" by generating millions of mutants and then selecting the \"winners\" with the best functional properties. We study these unique variants to determine how cellular receptors become activated and to guide the development of precisely targeted therapeutics. Our expertise with yeast display allows us to evolve complex eukaryotic proteins, which creates new avenues for the manipulation of difficult-to-target mammalian signaling pathways. Current projects in the lab integrate directed evolution with x-ray crystallography, computational modeling, and cell biology to illuminate receptor systems involved in the development of stem cells.\n  *": 2,
    "Dr. Locke is a physician and translational investigator specializing in the treatment of lymphoma and multiple myeloma in the Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation at Moffitt. He is focused on developing strategies to promote T cell responses against tumor associated antigens for patients with these diseases and is the principal investigator for multiple cellular immunotherapy trials. He is a lead investigator for two national multi-center phase I/II studies treating aggressive lymphoma patients with anti-CD19 CAR T cells and the site PI of a randomized multi-center trial testing infusion of tumor (marrow) infiltrating lymphocytes for multiple myeloma. Dr. Locke\u2019s translational research evaluates T cell responses against tumor associated antigens and neoantigens in myeloma patients. His findings justified a trial evaluating the biological activity of a unique Moffitt-created survivin dendritic cell vaccine using a novel schedule in conjunction with autologous transplant. Dr. Locke is the Chair of the Moffitt Cellular Therapy Advisory Committee and the Chair of the Moffitt Immunotherapy Working Group. In addition he is the Service Chief of the Moffitt Immune and Cellular Therapy (ICE-T) service, which was created to provide specialized clinical care for patients undergoing cellular immunotherapy treatments.\n  *": 2,
    "Dr. Dunne\u2019s primary research interest is the development of technologies that improve the delivery efficiency of a wide range of therapeutics to solid tumors. Specifically, the Dune Lab focuses on using novel hydrogel materials in order to develop triggered-release, cell-based drug delivery therapeutics that modulate the tumor microenvironment in order to improve the efficacy of the current generation of cell and immuno-therapies. Additional research is focused on improving anti-cancer cell therapies by combining them with externally applied stimuli (e.g. radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and/or focused ultrasound) in order to alter immune cell accumulation and distribution within the tumor.\n  *": 2,
    "Dr. Sawyer\u2019s current research interests include visualizing the interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment using bio-printing techniques and precision engineering approaches using an ex vivo platform pioneered in his laboratory. Dr. Sawyer will build the new department at Moffitt Magnolia Campus prior to moving to the Moffitt Center for Innovation at Speros FL. There, the Department of BioEngineering will partner with other departments to accelerate the advances in cancer research and treatment.\n  *": 1
