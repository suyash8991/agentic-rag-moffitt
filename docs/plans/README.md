# Implementation Plans

This directory contains implementation plans for the Moffitt Agentic RAG system. These documents outline different approaches to migrating the application from its Streamlit implementation to a modern FastAPI/React architecture.

## Available Plans

### 1. [Accelerated Implementation Plan](accelerated_implementation_plan.md)

**Duration: 6 Weeks**

This plan focuses on quickly replacing the Streamlit application with a minimal but functional FastAPI/React implementation. It prioritizes:
- Essential features only
- Rapid development cycles
- Practical implementation steps
- Weekly task breakdown
- Progress tracking

**When to use:** When you need a working implementation as quickly as possible and can defer more advanced features to later iterations.

### 2. [Production Migration Plan](production_migration_plan.md)

**Duration: 16 Weeks**

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for converting the application into a production-ready system with enterprise-grade architecture. It covers:
- In-depth architecture recommendations
- Comprehensive technology stack options
- Performance optimization strategies
- Scaling considerations
- Risk mitigation approaches

**When to use:** When you're planning a full production migration that addresses all aspects of a scalable, maintainable system with proper architecture.

## Using These Plans

These plans are complementary and can be used together:

1. Use the **Accelerated Implementation Plan** for the initial migration to quickly replace Streamlit
2. Use the **Production Migration Plan** as a reference for longer-term architecture improvements

The current implementation is based primarily on the Accelerated Implementation Plan, with certain architectural decisions informed by the Production Migration Plan.

## Current Status

As of 2025-10-24, the project has successfully completed the migration from Streamlit to the FastAPI/React architecture following the Accelerated Implementation Plan, with the following features implemented:

- FastAPI backend with core endpoints
- React frontend with chat interface
- Vector database integration
- Agent implementation with LangChain
- Multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Groq)
- Basic WebSocket streaming
- Docker deployment configuration

See the main [README.md](../../README.md) and [DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md) for more details on the current implementation.
