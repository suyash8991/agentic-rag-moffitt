# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that have been consolidated into three main documentation files:

1. **README.md** (project root) - Project overview and setup instructions
2. **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Comprehensive code documentation
3. **TOOLS.md** - Specialized tools documentation

## Consolidation Map

These files were archived as part of a documentation consolidation effort:

| Archived File | Consolidated Into |
|--------------|------------------|
| agent_workflow.md | DEVELOPMENT.md |
| chromadb_chunking.md | DEVELOPMENT.md |
| code_documentation.md | DEVELOPMENT.md |
| Project_info.md | README.md (root) |
| tools_logic.md | TOOLS.md |
| researcher_search.md | TOOLS.md |
| input_data.md | DEVELOPMENT.md |
| index.md | README.md (root) |

The following files were archived as they contained historical development notes that are no longer actively maintained:

- conversation_history.md
- development_progress.md
- logging_fixes_plan.md

## Purpose

These files are kept for reference purposes but should not be considered the current documentation. Always refer to the main documentation files for up-to-date information.
