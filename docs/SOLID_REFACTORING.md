# SOLID Principles Refactoring Progress

This document tracks the progress of refactoring the Moffitt Agentic RAG System to better adhere to SOLID principles.

## SOLID Principles Overview

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one reason to change
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused commits that address specific SOLID violations
2. **Progress Tracking**: Update this document with each commit to track our progress
3. **Test Coverage**: Ensure proper test coverage for changes to maintain system stability
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation alongside code changes
5. **Code Review**: Regular review of changes to ensure SOLID adherence

## Current SOLID Violations and Planned Improvements

### 1. Agent Module (src/moffitt_rag/agents/agent.py)

**Current Issues**:
- Monolithic `create_researcher_agent` function (lines 145-320) violates SRP
- Direct dependency on concrete tool classes violates DIP
- No interfaces for different agent capabilities violates ISP

**Planned Improvements**:
- [x] Create `AgentFactory` class with specialized methods for each creation step
- [x] Extract LLM initialization into a separate service class
- [x] Create proper interfaces for agent capabilities (reflection, tool usage)
- [x] Use dependency injection for tools instead of direct instantiation
- [x] Split large functions into smaller, focused methods

**Implementation Plan**:
1. ✅ First commit: Create interfaces for agent capabilities
2. ✅ Second commit: Implement `AgentFactory` class with basic structure
3. ✅ Third commit: Extract LLM initialization logic
4. ✅ Fourth commit: Refactor tool creation with dependency injection
5. ✅ Fifth commit: Update calling code to use the new factory

### 2. Tools Module (src/moffitt_rag/tools/*.py)

**Current Issues**:
- `ResearcherSearchTool` handles too many responsibilities (violates SRP)
- Tools don't share a common inheritance hierarchy (violates LSP)
- Helper functions are not organized into cohesive classes (violates SRP)
- No extension mechanism for adding new tools (violates OCP)

**Planned Improvements**:
- [x] Create a proper tool hierarchy with base classes and interfaces
- [ ] Extract search logic into strategy classes
- [x] Move helper functions into utility classes
- [ ] Implement a plugin-like architecture for tool registration
- [x] Create separate formatters for different result types

**Implementation Plan**:
1. ✅ First commit: Define tool interfaces and base classes
2. ✅ Second commit: Create utility classes for helper functions
3. Third commit: Refactor `ResearcherSearchTool` to use strategy pattern
4. Fourth commit: Implement tool registration mechanism
5. Fifth commit: Refactor other tools to use the new architecture

### 3. Database Access (src/moffitt_rag/db/*.py)

**Current Issues**:
- Database implementation is tightly coupled to ChromaDB (violates DIP)
- Large functions with multiple responsibilities (violates SRP)
- Direct dependence on concrete implementations (violates DIP)
- No abstraction for different database operations (violates ISP)

**Planned Improvements**:
- [ ] Create database access interfaces
- [ ] Implement ChromaDB adapter as one implementation
- [ ] Split large functions into strategy classes
- [ ] Create repository pattern for database access
- [ ] Extract search strategies into separate classes

**Implementation Plan**:
1. First commit: Define database interface
2. Second commit: Implement ChromaDB adapter
3. Third commit: Extract search strategies
4. Fourth commit: Implement repository pattern
5. Fifth commit: Update calling code to use the new interfaces

### 4. Data Models (src/moffitt_rag/data/models.py)

**Current Issues**:
- Document conversion logic is embedded in data models (violates SRP)
- No clear interfaces for different model capabilities (violates ISP)
- Direct coupling to database format (violates DIP)

**Planned Improvements**:
- [ ] Create mapper classes for document conversion
- [ ] Define interfaces for different model capabilities
- [ ] Decouple models from database format
- [ ] Create factory methods for model creation

**Implementation Plan**:
1. First commit: Define model interfaces
2. Second commit: Create mapper classes
3. Third commit: Update database code to use mappers
4. Fourth commit: Implement factory methods
5. Fifth commit: Remove conversion logic from models

### 5. UI Implementation (src/moffitt_rag/streamlit/*.py)

**Current Issues**:
- UI components directly interact with business logic (violates SRP)
- Large render functions with multiple responsibilities (violates SRP)
- Session state management is tightly coupled to UI (violates DIP)

**Planned Improvements**:
- [ ] Create view model classes for UI-business logic separation
- [ ] Extract business logic into service classes
- [ ] Break down large render functions
- [ ] Implement cleaner state management
- [ ] Create proper abstractions for UI components

**Implementation Plan**:
1. First commit: Create service classes for business logic
2. Second commit: Implement view model pattern
3. Third commit: Refactor state management
4. Fourth commit: Break down render functions
5. Fifth commit: Update UI components to use new architecture

## Progress Tracking

| Date | Component | Principle | Description | Commit |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-21 | Documentation | All | Created SOLID refactoring progress document | TBD |
| 2025-10-21 | Agents | SRP, OCP, ISP, DIP | Created agent interfaces, implemented factory pattern, updated agent.py | TBD |
| 2025-10-21 | Tools | SRP, OCP, ISP, LSP | Created tool interfaces, base classes, and utility classes | TBD |

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand and maintain
2. **Extensibility**: Clear interfaces make it easier to add new features
3. **Testability**: Decoupled components are easier to test in isolation
4. **Code Reuse**: Well-defined abstractions promote code reuse
5. **Scalability**: SOLID principles enable better scaling of the codebase
