## Current Limitations Analysis

The current Streamlit implementation has several limitations that make it unsuitable for production-level deployment:

### Performance Limitations
- Streamlit reloads the entire app on state changes, causing inefficient processing
- The current implementation reloads the vector database on page refresh
- UI interactions trigger full page reruns instead of targeted updates

### Scalability Constraints
- Limited ability to handle concurrent users effectively
- No built-in load balancing or horizontal scaling capabilities
- Resource usage increases linearly with user count

### Architecture Issues
- Tight coupling between UI and backend logic
- No clear separation between presentation and application logic
- Agent creation and invocation happen within the UI code

### Production Readiness Gaps
- Limited monitoring and observability features
- No robust authentication and authorization system
- Insufficient error handling for production environments

## Recommended Architecture

### Backend API Architecture

We recommend a clean layered architecture that clearly separates concerns:

#### Layered Architecture

**API Layer (Controllers/Endpoints)**
- Handles HTTP requests/responses
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Routing to appropriate services

**Service Layer (Business Logic)**
- Orchestrates the execution of business logic
- Manages the RAG workflow
- Coordinates between repositories and external services
- Implements caching strategies
- Contains no direct HTTP or database access code

**Repository Layer (Data Access)**
- Abstracts database operations
- Manages vector database interactions
- Handles data retrieval and storage
- Provides clean interfaces for the service layer

**Domain Layer**
- Contains domain models and business rules
- Houses the core entities like ResearcherProfile, ResearcherChunk, etc.
- Implements domain-specific validation logic
- Remains framework-agnostic

#### Core API Endpoints

Based on the current Streamlit application, we recommend the following core API endpoints:

**Researcher Endpoints**
```
GET /api/researchers - List researchers (with pagination and filters)
GET /api/researchers/{id} - Get a specific researcher
GET /api/departments - List available departments
GET /api/programs - List available programs
```

**Query Endpoints**
```
POST /api/query - Execute a query against the RAG system
GET /api/query/{id} - Get the status/result of an in-progress query
POST /api/query/{id}/feedback - Submit feedback for a query
```

**Admin Endpoints**
```
POST /api/admin/vector-db/rebuild - Rebuild the vector database
GET /api/admin/stats - Get system statistics
POST /api/admin/reload - Reload models or configuration
```

**Session/User Management**
```
POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate a user
POST /api/auth/logout - End a user session
GET /api/user/history - Get query history for a user
```

#### Key Backend Components

**Query Processing Service**
- Manages the lifecycle of a query
- Implements the main agent workflow
- Handles tool selection and execution

**Vector Database Service**
- Provides an abstraction over ChromaDB
- Manages chunking and embedding

- Optimizes for common queries

**Streaming Service**
- Manages WebSocket connections
- Handles streaming responses to clients
- Implements connection backpressure handling

#### Asynchronous Processing

One of the key improvements over the Streamlit implementation would be proper async processing:

- **Task Queue System** (Celery/Redis or similar)
  - Offload long-running operations like database rebuilds
  - Process queries asynchronously
  - Schedule periodic maintenance tasks

- **WebSocket Support**
  - Stream responses as they're generated
  - Provide real-time updates on query status
  - Implement token-by-token streaming for LLM responses
