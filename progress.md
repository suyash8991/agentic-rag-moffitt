# Moffitt Cancer Center Project Progress Report

*Last updated: October 13, 2025*

## Project Status: Phase 1 (Web Scraping) â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“ 100%
## Project Status: Phase 2 (Agentic RAG) â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 10%

### Completed Tasks

#### Web Scraping Framework
- âœ… Set up project structure with proper directory organization
- âœ… Implemented URL extraction from Excel file
- âœ… Created crawler module with rate limiting and error handling
- âœ… Added HTML â†’ Markdown conversion using Crawl4AI
- âœ… Developed parser to extract structured data from Markdown
- âœ… Designed schema for researcher profile validation
- âœ… Built modular components for easy maintenance
- âœ… Created unified pipeline for complete processing
- âœ… Set up Git repository with logical commits

#### Current Capabilities
- Can extract researcher profiles from the Moffitt Cancer Center website
- Parses key information including:
  - Name and degrees
  - Title and position
  - Program affiliations
  - Research overview
  - Research interests
  - Education & training
  - Publications
  - Grants
  - Contact information
- Stores data in three formats:
  - Raw HTML (for archival purposes)
  - Markdown (for readability)
  - Structured JSON (for processing)

### In Progress

- Setting up the initial project structure for Phase 2
- Creating data loading module for researcher profiles
- Implementing the vector database infrastructure
- Developing embedding generation pipeline

### Next Steps

- Complete the vector database setup
- Implement hybrid search functionality
- Create the agentic orchestration layer
- Build specialized tools for researcher queries
- Develop the frontend interface

## Challenges & Solutions

### Current Challenges
- **Varying profile formats**: Some researcher profiles have different section organizations
  - *Solution*: Enhanced parser to handle multiple section formats

- **Rate limiting needs**: Need to respect Moffitt's servers
  - *Solution*: Implemented random delays between requests (2-5 seconds)

### Current Challenges
- **Processing diverse researcher text**: Researcher profiles have varying formats and content focus
  - *Solution*: Implementing robust chunking strategies for optimal embedding

- **Hybrid search implementation**: Need to balance semantic and keyword search
  - *Solution*: Developing a weighted approach that adjusts based on query type

### Upcoming Challenges
- Creating an agent that can intelligently select the right tools
- Developing a response synthesizer that provides accurate citations
- Building effective visualizations for researcher networks

## Phase 2 Progress

### Week 1 (Current)
- âœ… Set up project structure with modern Python practices
- âœ… Implemented configuration management using Pydantic
- âœ… Created environment-based settings
- ðŸ”„ Working on data loading and chunking strategies
- ðŸ”„ Setting up Chroma vector database

### Week 2 (Upcoming)
- Implement embedding generation pipeline
- Create hybrid search functionality
- Begin development of agent tools
- Start designing orchestration layer
